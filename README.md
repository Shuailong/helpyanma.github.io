### Features

1. To-do list

  This function is to encourage people to finish their tasks. 

  In our daily life, we would have a lot of tasks to do. However, sometimes we may not finish them in time. This function is for people to encourage each other to finish the tasks as soon as possible. 

  **Rules**: there should be one page and everyone can add his own tasks or even others tasks to the list. For example, I have a plan to do something which is not private, then I can add it to the to-do list. Or if I know someone has a plan to do something, then I can add it to the to-do list. Everyone can see the tasks on the website, so everyone can encourage others to finish their plan as soon as possible.
